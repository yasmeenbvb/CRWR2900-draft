Diary from the forest: Some weird memories, and experiences from the forest

I like forests. I always have, ever since I was little. I liked strolling through the forests to my elementary school on winter days when the snow was piling up on the branches and leaves. It felt like Narnia, some magical place. 
I remember trying to get lost in that tiny forest, because I thought it would be an adventure, and feeling disappointed that no matter how hard I tried, I knew the way. 
Forests have also been weird places for me. In the first grade my mother warned me not to play near the barb wired fence that separated the forest from the playground, not because thugs and thieves, but because of my best friend’s weird old grandmother would hide in the forest and give us starburst candy through the fence when she saw us. 
I didn’t listen to my mom though. Eventually the school talked to her crazy grandma, which didn’t stop her. A few weeks late she just showed up in the forest dressed head to toe in camo passing starbursts through the fence.
I always thought this woman was crazy- but the good kind of crazy where you get free candy.
But looking back I realize how sad that was. See, my best friend’s family had issues, and because of those issues, her grandma never got to see her. So she had to dress up in camo and feed fence starbursts to her own grandchild, cause that’s all she could get.

Another weird nature story...
The day I was allowed to ride my bike to the watershed with my friends and no parents, was a pretty significant day for myself and my grade 7 clan. Remember how I said I wanted to get lost? Well that turned out to not be as fun as I had intended. 

Notes from Today:

I sat in the sun today which was nice. I actually never really sit in the sun anymore, and I didn't realize until today that it was something I was lacking. I watched everyone rush to the labryth, and walk through at their own pace, and I have every intention of taking my turn, but for some strange reason, all I wanted to do was sit in the sun.
I'm really a busy person. 
I have 5 classes this semester. 4 literature classes, and this creative writing. I work full time as an office assistant. So, I don't often have time to just sit in the sun. So it was nice to do that today. 
It felt zen. And realxing. I just sat there, writing in my journal.

This meditating stuff is also kind of weird for me, because I never do it. 

My family is strange because on one side you have a bunch of crazy muslims, and I mean that in the least offensive way as posssible, but they are crazy. And on the other side there's a bunch of crazy hindu hippies. Again, no offensiveness intended. The Hindu side is really into meditiating and being zen and burning insence, veganism (shudders) and whatnot. And the Muslim side is all about praying on their hands and knees ten times a day, which I guess in a way is kind of like meditation. But my little immediate family is quite different. My mom isn't religious, and my dad is an ex-Catholic. Our family is traditional, but I never grew up with devotion to meditation, and the zen lifestyle, nor the devotion to a religion. I guess growing up, I'd laugh at my relatives for being religious nutjobs, and I guess I still do, but I've come to understand the value in their beleifs. Maybe not their specific beleifs, but the fact that they have those beleifs and they build their lives upon it.
My point? Well I tell myself I'm too busy for sitting in the sun, writing in journals..etc.. But that isn't true. 
My crazy relatives value their beleifs and so they make time for it, and I guess I can learn something from that.

I really don't know if i'm going to keep all of this nonesesne rambling in my work, but I'll leave it here in case.

Redwood Park


Through bushes. Into paths that werent really paths, but someone ad clearly been walking on. And I keep walking thinking I'll hit the gravel pathway, but I don't. Which is weirdly unnerving, even though I know its a small park, and if I keep walking the way I came, I'll run right back into that stupid little fairy queen hideaway and be just fine.

I like forests. I always have. 

Ever since I was little, I liked strolling through the forest to school on winter days when the snow was weighing down on up the branches and leaves, ocassionally dumping a pile of feathery snow onto the hood of whoever was walking by. It felt like Narnia, some magical place where we interacted with the forest. 

I honestly miss those days where we were so easy to entertain. Where a walk through the forest brought so much joy that I hardly noticed that my socks were soaked becuase my boots weren't waterproof. We were cold and uncomfortable, but it didn't really matter.

I remember trying to get lost in that tiny forest, because I thought it would be an adventure, and feeling disappointed that no matter how hard I tried, I always knew the way. How weird is that? People die from getting lost in the woods, and here I am atempting to do that exact thing. Of course, there was no real danger. I guess I craved that sheltered sense of adventure. You know that adrenaline rush even when there's no need because you know you're totally fine.
Some things never change though. Walking through Redwood Park I did the same. I tried to get lost, just for fun. 

I actually got lost in the forrest for like 10 minutes. Well I wasn't really THAT lost because the forrest was far too small, but lost enough where I couldn't hear or see anyone. And lost enough to start to feel that mild sense of anxiety, which is so weird cause you know you're okay but you lose direction ever so slightly that it throws you off.

Through bushes. Into paths that werent really paths, but someone had clearly been walking on. And I keep walking thinking I'll hit the gravel pathway, but I don't. Which is weirdly unnerving, even though I know its a small park, and if I keep walking the way I came, I'll run right back into that stupid little fairy queen hideaway and be just fine. 

Forests have also been weird places for me. In the first grade my mom warned me not to play near the barb wired fence that separated the forest from the playground at school. she wasn't worried about thugs and thieves, rather my best friend’s weird old grandmother who would hide in the forest and give us starburst candy through the fence when she saw us. 

It seems innocent enough really. A sweet old grandma, giving her grandchild candy, until you realize that the reason she did that was because she wasn't allowed to see her grandchild, my best friend. Funny how a cute story of a crazy old woman becomes oddly sad when you look back at it as an adult. Family problems and divorce lead to cutting people out to the point where old women dress up in camo and hide in the forrest with a pocket full of starburst because that's the only form of affection they are able to give. 

In my old house we had trees. Big apple and pear trees, and bushes with berries, nad a garden full of vegtables. It was so bright and colourful. My dad put a tire swing on one of the trees and I spent hours on it. I remember a friend of mine, Kassaundra, who lived just down the street would come over and spend hours on the swing with me.

She was the adventurous one and so she would wrap her legs through the inside of the tire and dangle with her head underneath her so her uncut blonde hair would sweep across the ground.

I never did that. I was scared, and if we're being honest it still freaks me out. I guess I'm just not that adventurous, but that's not the point.. 


Notes: Leaves on the stairs in the forrest, arches, Bridge covered in leaves with the stream underneath. Salmon, birds. Nature-- interacting with wildlife as well as peers. More social outing
