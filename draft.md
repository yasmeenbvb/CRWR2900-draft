Notes from Burns Bog
Burns Bog was nice. I actually didn't really know what to expect. I've lived here my entire life and never been.
It was interesting how you could turn the corner and discover completely different plants...etc. All these different habitats within one small place I didnt even know was there.

I'm making some notes...
