Diary from the forest: Some weird memories, and experiences from the forest

I like forests. I always have, ever since I was little. I liked strolling through the forests to my elementary school on winter days when the snow was piling up on the branches and leaves. It felt like Narnia, some magical place. 
I remember trying to get lost in that tiny forest, because I thought it would be an adventure, and feeling disappointed that no matter how hard I tried, I knew the way. 
Forests have also been weird places for me. In the first grade my mother warned me not to play near the barb wired fence that separated the forest from the playground, not because thugs and thieves, but because of my best friend’s weird old grandmother would hide in the forest and give us starburst candy through the fence when she saw us. 
I didn’t listen to my mom though. Eventually the school talked to her crazy grandma, which didn’t stop her. A few weeks late she just showed up in the forest dressed head to toe in camo passing starbursts through the fence.
I always thought this woman was crazy- but the good kind of crazy where you get free candy.
But looking back I realize how sad that was. See, my best friend’s family had issues, and because of those issues, her grandma never got to see her. So she had to dress up in camo and feed fence starbursts to her own grandchild, cause that’s all she could get.

Another weird nature story...
The day I was allowed to ride my bike to the watershed with my friends and no parents, was a pretty significant day for myself and my grade 7 clan. Remember how I said I wanted to get lost? Well that turned out to not be as fun as I had intended. 

Notes from Today:

I sat in the sun today which was nice. I actually never really sit in the sun anymore, and I didn't realize until today that it was something I was lacking. I watched everyone rush to the labryth, and walk through at their own pace, and I have every intention of taking my turn, but for some strange reason, all I wanted to do was sit in the sun.
I'm really a busy person. 
I have 5 classes this semester. 4 literature classes, and this creative writing. I work full time as an office assistant. So, I don't often have time to just sit in the sun. So it was nice to do that today. 
It felt zen. And realxing. I just sat there, writing in my journal.

This meditating stuff is also kind of weird for me, because I never do it. 

My family is strange because on one side you have a bunch of crazy muslims, and I mean that in the least offensive way as posssible, but they are crazy. And on the other side there's a bunch of crazy hindu hippies. Again, no offensiveness intended. The Hindu side is really into meditiating and being zen and burning insence, veganism (shudders) and whatnot. And the Muslim side is all about praying on their hands and knees ten times a day, which I guess in a way is kind of like meditation. But my little immediate family is quite different. My mom isn't religious, and my dad is an ex-Catholic. Our family is traditional, but I never grew up with devotion to meditation, and the zen lifestyle, nor the devotion to a religion. I guess growing up, I'd laugh at my relatives for being religious nutjobs, and I guess I still do, but I've come to understand the value in their beleifs. Maybe not their specific beleifs, but the fact that they have those beleifs and they build their lives upon it.
My point? Well I tell myself I'm too busy for sitting in the sun, writing in journals..etc.. But that isn't true. 
My crazy relatives value their beleifs and so they make time for it, and I guess I can learn something from that.

I really don't know if i'm going to keep all of this nonesesne rambling in my work, but I'll leave it here in case.
