# Asking for Help

## GitHub Issues
Sometimes you might need to ask questions outside of class (for example, when you are working on your document at home). There are two ways to ask for help: you can create an `issue` (see below) or you can [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/creative-writing-kpu/Lobby#). The simplest option is to create an issue. If a more organic, conversational approach is called for, your instructor will invite you to a gitter conversation.

## Creating an Issue
To create an issue, access the [GitHub website](www.github.com), and navigate to your repository. Select the `Issues` tab, then select `New Issue`. The new issue screen will provide a box for `title` and for `description`.
  * Title: should concisely summarize your question, (for example, "How could I create better atmosphere in my text"?). Please do not ask questions about subjects already covered in the Wiki or which are easily searchable online. Your title should **_not_** have a non-descriptive title such as "Question".
  
  * Description: this should describe the issue you are facing, with enough information for your instructor to provide a solution. GitHub supports Markdown, which allows quick text formatting in issues. (See [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).) You can also add a label to your issue if you want, but this is entirely optional.

You will need to _assign_ this issue to your instructor (Ross), who will get back to you as soon as possible. Under the `Assignees` tab to the right of the issue description, select the gear button; GitHub will suggest Ross as your assignee. Click Ross' username. If Ross' username is not immediately visible, just type "rosslaird" (without the quotes) into the Assignee box. You may aslo [mention](https://github.com/blog/821-mention-somebody-they-re-notified) Ross in the context of any issue, and he will be notified.

## Closing an issue
Ross will respond as soon as possible, either by requesting more information or providing an answer to your question. Sometimes, issues will not have a straightforward answer and will lead to _discussion_. This is an important part of the online development process and a vital tool for creative people working online. Once your question has been answered to your satisfaction, you can choose to close the issue, indicating it has been successfully resolved, by selecting the `close` button in the comment box.
